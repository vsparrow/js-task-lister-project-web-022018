issues:

c)if list title is blank requered validation alert not popping up rather an alert popup  needed



Maybe:
a)can only have 3 lists, unlike demo which can have many....
appears I may have closed something?
reran test and added 9 boxes all 9 showed up


DONE:

b)when all lists removed get this error
    Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'addEventListener' of null
        at addEventListenerForCreateTaskForm (index.js:127)
        at taskBuilder (index.js:224)
